ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @juniobiel.

I like to work in development about software and Games. I'm working on studies project to increase my habilities.

I gennerally colaborate with colleagues to built something and improve our habilities, using colaborative knowledge.

ðŸŽ® WOWA is my recent project that we working to develop a game and deploy it on playstore, it is under construction. *I need remember to update this readme

At 2013 I already started my studies in course of HTML, CSS and JS. It's triggered my curiosity about software development. When I have completed high school, I started to study Software Engineering at UTFPR. In some consequences, I stoped and started tecnhological game development course at PUC-CAMPINAS.

Now I'm starting study about Computer Engineering at USF Itatiba.

Here, you will find some projects that I working to study.

Actually, I am software developer at IBM, but the projects that I work in there is not public.

I develop using .NET and C#, I can use the same language to develop web or games softwares ðŸ˜‰
